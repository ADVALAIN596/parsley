This sub paragraph deals with the installation of the Parsley, based on compiled binary files for common users.
Before installing Parsley, make sure that your computer system fulfills the following requirements:
 * Parsley is designed for Windows operating systems.
 * Install the _Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1_ - download from the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx MicrosoftDownloadCenter].
 * Install the _Microsoft 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) Service Pack 1_ - available at [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx MicrosoftDownloadCenter].

After installing these software packages successfully, download the Parsley 0.2 binaries, which are available as ZIP file, from the Parsley [Downloads] page.
Now, create a folder on the Windows partition (e.g. C:\Programs\Parsley\) and extract the contents of the ZIP file into the folder.
Your newly created Parsley folder should now contain several *dll* files, the *Parsley executable* (Parsley.exe) and a folder called *Patterns*, containing _Marker Images_ and different pdf files with *!CalibrationPatterns* ready for printing.

If your Parsley installation has been successful, the Parsley _Welcome Window_ should appear soon after the executable file has been started.
