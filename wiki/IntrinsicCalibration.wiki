#summary General description of the Intrinsic Calibration and how to perform it using Parsley

= Introduction =

Camera calibration is used to determine a set of parameters which are used to describe the mapping between the 3D environment and the produced 2D camera image.
These parameters can be subdivided into two groups.
 * The Intrinsic Camera Parameters describe the internal geometry of a camera including radial and tangential distortion coefficients.
 * The Extrinsic Camera Parameters describe the relation between the 3D camera coordinate system (located in the projection center) and a given world coordinate system (position and orientation).


The following chapter describes how to perform the intrinsic calibration with Parsley.

= Intrinsic Calibration =
Intrinsic Camera Parameters define the internal geometry of the camera. This parameter set includes the focal lengths, the principal point (image center) and the distortion coefficients (see [http://code.google.com/p/parsley/wiki/CoordinateSystems Camera Coordinate System]). 
These parameters are independent of the camera position and orientation relative to the world coordinate system. The intrinsic calibration is used to reduce/eliminate the lense distortion. It is obvious that the extrinsic calibration *depends* on the results and the accuracy of the intrinsic calibration, since small distortion is essential for estimating the coordinate transformation matrix (combined rotation of translation) properly.
