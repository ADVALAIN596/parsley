#Summary General description of the Intrinsic Calibration and how to perform it using Parsley.

= Introduction =

Camera calibration is used to determine a set of parameters which are used to describe the mapping between the 3D environment and the produced 2D camera image.
These parameters can be subdivided into two groups.
 * The Intrinsic Camera Parameters describe the internal geometry of a camera including radial and tangential distortion coefficients.
 * The Extrinsic Camera Parameters describe the relation between the 3D camera coordinate system (located in the projection center) and a given world coordinate system (position and orientation).


The following chapter describes how to perform the intrinsic calibration with Parsley.
