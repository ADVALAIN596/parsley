#summary Coordinate systems found in Parsley

= Introduction =
Parsley and it's third-party libraries need to operate on different coordinate frames. Therefore, coordination and mapping between those coordinate frames is crucial. The following components in Parsley manipulate coordinate frames
 * _Parsley.Core_ 
 * _Emgu_
 * _OpenCV_
 * _System.Drawing_
 * _!OpenSceneGraph_
 
The following coordinate systems will apply to all components, unless otherwise noted.
Parsley uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-handed_coordinate_system right-handed] coordinate systems. When expressed as matrix, _Parsley.Core_|_Emgu_|_OpenCV_ store basis vectors in columns. In the case of homogeneous coordinates, the translation is therefore found in the fourth column. _!OpenSceneGraph_ stores basis vectors in rows, which requires a matrix transposition to convert to matrices expressed in the components _Parsley.Core_|_Emgu_|_OpenCV_.

= Image Coordinate System =
The image coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system. The units are in pixels.
