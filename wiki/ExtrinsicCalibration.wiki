#summary Notices on extrinsic camera calibration

Currently two kind of patterns for extrinsic calibration are supported.
 * Checkerboard pattern
 * Circle pattern

==Circle Pattern==
Circles become ellipses under perspective detection. The pattern detection is therefore based on ellipses. To detect the ellipses and bring them into correspondence with the calibrator we can do the following:
 * order the ellipses based on their distance from the image origin and top-left calibrator circle. This has the disadvantage that a special pattern is required to avoid ambiguities.
 * Order them as described in [http://www.springerlink.com/content/88887008437r1543/ Robust detection and ordering of ellipses on a calibration pattern].
