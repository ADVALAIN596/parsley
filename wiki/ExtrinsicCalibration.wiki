#summary Notices on extrinsic camera calibration

Extrinsic calibration through checkerboard detection works, but requires a lot of 'black' color that prevents the laser to be detected.

Alternatively we could 
 * use a checkerboard pattern with fewer fields
 * instead of filled fields use border-filled fields
 * use [http://users.dsic.upv.es/~fjabad/research/material/iciar2004.pdf one circle]
